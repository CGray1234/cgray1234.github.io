<h1>This website's code is migrating to HTML</h1>
<span>If you're a developer, this is probably irrelevant. I'm not going to go into details about what HTML is, so I'm going to give a simple explanation:

<br>

This website is written in a language called <code>Markdown</code>.

<br>

Using <code>Markdown</code>, I have learned how to code in <code>HTML</code> because <code>Markdown</code> can have <code>HTML</code> in it.

<br>

I prefer <code>HTML</code> because it gives me a bit more control over the website. Therefore, this website's code will be migrated to <code>HTML</code>.

<br>

<h1>So, what does this mean?</h1>

<span>This means that development on this will slow down over the next couple of days/weeks as I rewrite the code in <code>HTML</code>.

<br>

Yes, development will still be continued, but will slow down. (i.e. only announcements will still be consistently updated)
