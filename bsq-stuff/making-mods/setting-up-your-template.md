# Setting up your template
## Now that we have everything set up, we can now set up out template to get ready for making our mod.
<br/>

Press `Ctrl + Shift + P` and click on "Create Project from Template"  
<br/>

Select your unzipped Quest mod template folder  
<br/>

It should ask your for your id first. This is your mod id, which MUST be all one word. Ex: Test-Mod, TestMod, etc.  
<br/>

Set your `ndkpath`. This is the path for your Android NDK that you downloaded using FORWARD SLASHES, NOT BACKWARDS SLASHES! Mine is set to `C:/Program Files/android-ndk-r23b-windows/android-ndk-r23b`.  
<br/>

Your mod name should be... well... the mod's name (shocker). You can use spaces in your mod's name, but not the id.  
<br/>

The author should preferably be your Discord or GitHub username.  
<br/>

The description should be a brief explanation of what your mod does.  
<br/>


## Now that we have our template set up, we can move onto editing our mod.json
