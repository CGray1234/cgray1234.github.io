# Prerequisites:
### Install [QPM-Rust](https://github.com/RedBrumbler/QuestPackageManager-Rust/actions) and [add it to your PATH](https://helpdeskgeek.com/windows-10/add-windows-path-environment-variable/). 
<br/>

### Install [Ninja](https://github.com/ninja-build/ninja/releases) and add it to your PATH
<br/>

### Install [Project Templates](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=cantonios.project-templates) for Visual Studio Code (alternitavely, you can use Templatr, but I prefer to use Project Templates)
<br/>

### Install [Android NDK](https://developer.android.com/ndk/downloads) and add it to your PATH
<br/>

### (Optional, but highly recommended) Install [Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools#downloads) and add it to your PATH. This will allow us to run the `copy.ps1` command to easily put your mods onto your Quest without having to go through BMBF.
<br/>

### Download the [Quest mod template](https://github.com/Lauriethefish/quest-mod-template/releases/download/0.5.0/quest-mod-template.zip) by [Lauriethefish](https://github.com/Lauriethefish), unzip it, and add it to your project templates folder by pressing Ctrl + Shift + P in VSCode and clicking "open templates folder"
<br/>
