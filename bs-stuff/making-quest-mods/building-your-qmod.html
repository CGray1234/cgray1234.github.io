<h1>You're so close! All that's left is building the qmod.</h1>
<h2>You are so close to finishing your first mod! All we need to do now is make our qmod file.</h2>
<br/>

<h1>To make our qmod file:</h1>
<h2>Open a PowerShell terminal and input the following code:</h2>
<code>
./buildQMOD.ps1 TestMod
</code>  
<h2>You can change the TestMod to whatever you'd like. Once completed, there should be a qmod file in your folder!</h2>

<h2>Pat yourself on the back, you've just made your first Beat Saber mod for the Oculus Quest! Now, try making some on your own.
