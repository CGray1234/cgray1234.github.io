# You're so close! All that's left is building the qmod.
You are so close to finishing your first mod! All we need to do now is make our qmod file.  
<br/>

## To make our qmod file:
Open a PowerShell terminal and input the following code:
```
./buildQMOD.ps1 TestMod
```  
You can change the TestMod to whatever you'd like. Once completed, there should be a qmod file in your folder!

# Congratulations! You're finished!
Pat yourself on the back, you've just made your first Beat Saber mod for the Oculus Quest! Now, try making some on your own. If you have any questions about making mods, I highly recommend you refer to [#quest-mod-dev](https://discord.com/channels/441805394323439646/583108561396170837) in the [BSMG Discord](https://discord.gg/beatsabermods). Good luck on any more mods you may make!
